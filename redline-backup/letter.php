			<p>Good Afternoon,</p>

			<p>As a business owner in an industry where every detail matters, it is my duty and 
				obligation to abide by that mantra both in the shop turning wrenches and in the 
				office pushing paper. As pedigree, heritage and accuracy are of my foremost concern, 
				full disclosure and honesty is the only policy.</p>

			<p>With that being said, it is my unfortunate but necessary responsibility to inform you 
				all of a recent staffing and subsequent criminal issue here at the shop. An individual 
				was hired earlier this year on the good faith of his experience and supposed connections, 
				both of which turned out to be less than scrupulous and mere pretense.</p>

			<p>Lukas Lento, a.k.a. Peter Sinkevich, was arrested on May 20, 2013 on charges of 2nd degree 
				larceny, 1st degree computer crime, credit card theft, credit card fraud and receipt of 
				goods from an ill use credit card. His arraignment is today, June 27, 2013 in Bridgeport 
				Superior Court where he will have the opportunity to plead.</p>

			<a href="http://www.jud2.ct.gov/crdockets/CaseDetail.aspx?source=Pending&Key=93140edc-07fb-449d-80e4-912f06747303" target="_blank">Case Details</a>

			<p>First and foremost, I would like to assure each and everyone of you that Mr. Sinkevich's 
				actions were all internally-related and have not affected any of your personal records or 
				information. Protecting your privacy and security are of my utmost concern, and Mr. Sinkevich's 
				personal computer and cell phone were both seized for the purposes of damage control.</p>

			<p>Mr. Sinkevich has since attempted to defame me, my family and my business, and it has been brought 
				to my attention that he has gone as far as contacting some of you via telephone with the malicious 
				purpose of slander. I do not take these libelous accusations lightly, and additional charges have 
				been pressed and further litigation brought against Mr. Sinkevich.</p>

			<p>It appears Mr. Sinkevich has an ongoing history of similar behavior, and my purpose is not to vilify 
				his past, but rather to make him accountable for his present crimes, and more importantly, to warn 
				all of you as a professional courtesy should he attempt to contact you or propose any business to you.</p>

			<a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=19980108&id=MRNJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uwUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5175,723560" target="_blank">Additional Details</a>

			<p>Should you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding this matter or Mr. Sinkevich 
				specifically, please feel free to contact me directly and I will elucidate the facts to the very 
				best of my knowledge. I cannot undo what he has done, but I can prevent Mr. Sinkevich from any additional 
				criminal activity within my immediate networks, both personal and business.</p>

			<p>Many thanks for your time, attention and consideration, I sincerely appreciate it. As always, I look 
				forward to speaking with each and every one of you casually, professionally and in any other capacity. 
				My mission is to realize the goals and dreams you have envisioned, and to do so, I must perpetually 
				uphold the integrity of our business practices.</p>

			<p>Kindly,</p>
